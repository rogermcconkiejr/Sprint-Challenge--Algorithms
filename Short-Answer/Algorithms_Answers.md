## Exercise I

a) This runtime is constant - O(1).  This runtime will not change whatever the input for n is.  It will only use that input to perform a calculation.


b) This runtime logarthimic - O(logn).  As n increases, the runtime, or number of operations performed will grow at a slower rate.  This is because 'j' will be doubled everytime an iteration is performed, whereas 'n' grows at a constant rate.  Therefore, the number of iterations required for 'j' to hit 'n' will grow at a slower rate because 'j' will be growing much faster than 'n', and the operations will stop as soon as 'j' becomes greater than 'n'. 


c)  This runtime is linear - O(n).  As the size of n increases, the number of operations performed (as well as the amount of space used) will grow at the same rate.  In this case, it calls the function 'bunnies' at a linear rate.  However, it should be noted that since this function is recursive, it will use more space than an iterative function.
